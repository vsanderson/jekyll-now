## So-called quick release adapters are terrible

Do yourself a favor and stay away from bike pumps that use quick-release adapters. The popular Joe Blow pumps use these. These adapters are supposed to make connecting to the tire's Schrader or Presta valve quicker and easier. In fact, they do the opposite. They leak air, often need extensive fiddling before achieving a proper seal, and the seals wear out very quickly, in which case the manufacturer wants you to buy their adaptor-kit.

Just avoid all this hassle. Get a pump with a screw adapter.

The [Lezyne](http://www.lezyne.com/products-floorpumps.php) pumps are one brand that has these. In fact, their "ABS Flip-Thread" chuck works great.

The few seconds more it takes to screw a threaded chuck onto your tire valve is well worth it. The pump will inflate the tire right from the first try, with no leaking air or wasted strokes.

This may seem like a small thing, but it's one of those little things that you do all the time; why not get rid of an annoyance and make a necessary chore easier?
