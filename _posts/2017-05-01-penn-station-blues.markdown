### Penn Station is a design mess

I had the occasion to be in Penn Station the other day, and was reminded what a complete mess of a train station it is.
The station exemplifies the worst kind of architecture, a building plan resulting from politics superceding design. Penn Station is also a tragedy, since the original train station which was torn down to make way for the current one, was a beautiful airy and spacious Beaux Arts building.

Having to navigate Penn Station, especially if transferring from one train service to another, is a nightmare. I dread having to do it anytime I visit New York. Granted, that's not that often, so maybe you get used to it. Or at least inured to it. 650,000 travelers -- about the population of Boston -- are subjected to Penn Station each day.

Governor Cuomo has somewhat of a plan to improve Penn Station, but his idea doesn't fix anything about Penn Station itself. He wants to move Amtrak into the Farley Building -- the old post office -- across the street. But any plan that leaves the current station in place is not going to work. It's politics over design, *again.* The Times has a good article explaining what Cuomo's idea lacks: [Cuomo's Penn Station idea sucks](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/arts/design/cuomo-has-the-opportunity-to-fix-penn-station-but-will-he.html)

Here's the current Penn Station. Actually, what you're looking at is Madison Square Garden. You can't see the actual Penn Station, because it's **underneath** the Garden.

To see what the station could be, check out the vision of Vishaan Chakrabarti, the founder of Practice for Architecture and Urbanism. This plan makes it obvious that Madison Garden has to relocate. In its current position, it emprisons the train station like a malevolent spider, crushing any chance of a good architecture design. Governor Cuomo, move the **Garden** not the station!!
