I continue to be amazed by the simplicity of Clojure:

```clojure
(defn recursive-reverse [coll]
  (if (not (seq coll))
    coll
    (flatten (conj (list (first coll)) (recursive-reverse (rest coll))))))
```

Recursive Lisp is so expressive. I think this is my favorite part about Clojure. Even Ruby doesn't quite get the expressive simplicity achieved by Clojure.
