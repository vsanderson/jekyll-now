I continue to be amazed by the simplicity of Clojure. Here's a simple function to reverse a list using recursion.
Of course, recursion is not unique to Clojure: but recursion (and abstraction) are built into the Lisp family of languages
in fundamental way. It's part of their design, and leads to a programming style that focuses less on iteration and control structures, and more on data and the problem space. 

```clojure
(defn recursive-reverse [coll]
  (if (not (seq coll))
    coll
    (flatten (conj (list (first coll)) (recursive-reverse (rest coll))))))
```

Recursive Lisp is so expressive. I think this is my favorite part about Clojure. Even Ruby doesn't quite get the expressive simplicity achieved by Clojure.
