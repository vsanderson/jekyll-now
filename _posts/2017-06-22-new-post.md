### Scary but possible

To a cyclist, traffic can be very scary. Every cyclist has stories
about close calls with vehicles, road rage from motorists, which,
while entirely unjustified, can get the cyclist killed. A simple fact
for drivers: a collision with a bicycle may scratch your car, but it
can **kill** the cyclist.

I found this on the web today, a story by a dedicated cyclist writing
for Outside.

I think all cyclists navigate between their love of cycling and the
reality that the mere inattention of a motorist can spell disaster.

Yet, what to do? Nothing improves the world like bicycling. More and
more of us are becoming cyclists -- it's up to us to fight for safer
roads and driver awareness.
