### Scary but possible

I found this on the web today, a story by a dedicated cyclist writing
for Outside.

[Cyclist Writes Own Obituary](https://www.outsideonline.com/2193266/my-own-bike-obituary)

I think all cyclists navigate between their love of cycling and the
reality that the mere inattention of a motorist can spell disaster.

Yet, what to do? Nothing improves the world like bicycling. More and
more of us are becoming cyclists -- it's up to us to fight for safer
roads and driver awareness.
