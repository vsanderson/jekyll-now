Full disclosure: I'm a snowboarder. I love watching a good skier, though -- skiing is actually more difficult than snowboarding, and there are things you just can't do on a snowboard like you can on skis. 

However, there are things that shouldn't be done on skis. Tricks. Halfpipe. These things just look ridiculous on skis. There is just too much equipment.
And wipeouts are yardsales

Look how much better the snowboard looks. Simpler. More elegant.

I give skiers the edge in slalom.

But the snowboard doesn't exactly look bad.
