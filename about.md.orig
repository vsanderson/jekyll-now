I love developing code to solve problems. My primary language right now is Ruby, which I love for its high-level power, flexibility, everything-is-an-object attitude, and metaprogramming capabilities. More than any other language I've used (Java, C++, Python, PHP) it just works. Even when I'm not sure about a technique, I'll try it, and more often than not, it just works. 

However, I've recently discovered [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org), and it's quickly becoming a new passion. Always a fan of Lisp, Clojure brings Lisp features into the modern world. 

### More Information

Other interests are photography and bicycling. I combine these with my [bikeradical](http://www.bikeradical.com) project. I'm always snapping pictures of interesting and especially, vintage, bikes.
